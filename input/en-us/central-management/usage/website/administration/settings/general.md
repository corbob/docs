The Chocolatey Central Management Administration Settings page loads the General tab by default. This page is used to set the Chocolatey Central Management default timezone.

If a user does not set their own timezone for display from `My Settings`, then the selected timezone will be used for the display of all times within Chocolatey Central Management.
